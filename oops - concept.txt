2.  C++: OOPs Concept:
Introduction to C and C++

Before we get into the details of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, it’s helpful to understand the background of programming languages like C 
and why C++ was developed.

C Language: The C programming language, created in the 1970s, was one of the first widely used programming languages. It was designed for 
system programming and is known for being simple, efficient, and close to machine code, which made it ideal for creating operating systems and 
hardware-level software. C focuses on functions and procedures (also known as procedural programming), which means that programs are written as a 
series of steps or functions that operate on data.

-> C++ (1983):
- Creator: Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs.
- How It Evolved from C: C++ was designed as an extension of C to support object-oriented programming (OOP). While C focused on procedural programming, 
  C++ introduced key OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Influence: C++ retains much of C’s syntax, which made it easier for C programmers to transition to it. C++ was widely adopted for large-scale applications 
  where both performance and modularity were critical, such as in game development, embedded systems, and real-time applications.

Now, let's dive into the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

--- 
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes data and behavior into reusable units called classes and objects
---

 1. Class and Object

- Class: A class is like a blueprint or a plan. Imagine you want to build a house. You first need a plan or a blueprint that shows you how to build it. 
  This blueprint doesn’t actually create the house — it just tells you what materials and steps are needed. In the same way, a class in programming 
  is a blueprint that defines what an object should have (its features) and what it can do (its actions).

- Object: An object is like the actual house that you build from the blueprint. It’s a real instance created from the class blueprint. If the class is the 
plan for a house, the object is the actual house you can live in. In programming, objects are created from classes and represent real-world things.

Example: A class could be "Car", and an object would be "My Toyota" — a specific car you own.

 2. Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is like a safety box for data. It means putting the data (information) and the functions (actions) that work on that data together in one place. 
- But not all parts of the data are meant to be visible or accessible to everyone. Just like a bank account has private information (your PIN or balance), 
and you can't just grab it, encapsulation helps protect important data. You can access this information only through controlled methods (functions) that 
the class allows.

Example: Think of a TV remote. The remote allows you to change the volume or change channels, but you don’t need to know how the internal parts 
of the remote work. You just use it, and the remote takes care of the rest.

---

 3. Inheritance

- Inheritance is like family traits passed down from parents to children. Just like a child may inherit features from their parents, such as eye color or height,
in programming, a class can inherit features and actions from another class. This allows for code reuse.

Example: Imagine you have a general class called "Vehicle". Then, you can have a specific class for "Car" or "Bike", where they inherit common features 
from the Vehicle class (like having wheels or being able to move) but also have special features of their own (like a car having a horn or a bike having handlebars).

---

 4. Polymorphism

- Polymorphism means "many shapes" or "many forms". It allows one thing (like a function or method) to work in different ways, depending on the situation. 
In simpler terms, polymorphism lets us use the same action or command in different ways.

Example: Think of a smartphone. You can use your finger to tap on apps or buttons, but depending on the app, the tap can mean different things. 
For example, in a photo app, a tap could open a photo, while in a messaging app, a tap could send a message. The action (tapping) is the same, 
but the result is different depending on the context (the app).

---

 5. Abstraction

- Abstraction is about simplifying things. It means hiding the complex parts of something and only showing the important features. Imagine you’re using a car. 
You don’t need to know how the engine works or how the fuel flows to the engine to drive the car. You just need to know how to start the engine, steer, and brake. The complicated details are hidden from you.

Example: When you use a microwave, you just press a button for heating food. You don’t need to know how microwaves, radiation, or heat waves work internally — 
you just focus on what you need (heating food). In programming, abstraction lets you interact with a system without needing to understand all the internal workings.

---

 Summary

- Class and Object: A class is like a blueprint for creating objects, just as a house blueprint leads to the construction of actual houses.
- Encapsulation: Protects the important parts of data by hiding them from others, similar to how you protect your bank account details with a PIN.
- Inheritance: Allows new things to reuse and build on existing things, just like children inherit traits from parents.
- Polymorphism: Lets the same action do different things depending on the situation, like tapping your phone screen to do different things in different apps.
- Abstraction: Simplifies complex things by hiding unnecessary details, like how you use a car without needing to understand how the engine works.

By explaining these concepts in everyday terms and using simple analogies, a non-IT person can easily understand the core ideas of Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) without getting into the technical details!
